**What does it mean when a project is archived and moved to uber-archive org?**

It means that the project is deprecated and will not be actively developed or maintained any more. An archived project will not accept any new contribution going forward. However, it will remain public and can be forked and used. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to ospo@uber.com.
